# OpenID Connect authentication in Node.js with Passport

This repo is intended as sample code illustrating how to use OpenID Connect authentication in your Node.js/Express 4 app by using the [passport-openidconnect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-openidconnect) plugin for [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/).

I use mongodb for session storage using the [connect-mongodb-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongodb-session) plugin for [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session).

The folder structure should look similar to the one generated by [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) - run here with the --hbs option.

Authentication code is in `controllers/authentication.js`, and application routes are defined in `routes/index.js`.
